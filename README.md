# Mabinogi-Shyllien-Bot
This bot could harvest Shyllien and Hillwen for days! Made using AutoHotkey.

This bot uses image detection with AutoHotkey!

Similiar to my Carp Bot...
This could abused an old Mabinogi glitch which allowed you to mine behind the big middle ore if you had a warp pet or house coupon set there.

What could the bot do?
* Bot mines and picks up Shyllien and Hillwen Ores.
* Bot can detect when mining drill or wand is dead and replace it
* Bot can take "breaks" with a housing coupon to store ores and replace/fix equipment
* Bot can attempt reconnects if it detects a disconnect
* A ton more things! This thing would literally mine for days unchecked given you have the inventory space
